## Code Validation

### HTML

I have used the recommended [HTML W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org) to validate all of my HTML files.

As my project uses Jinja syntax, such as `{% for loops %}`, `{% url 'home' %}`, and `{{ variable|filter }}`
it will not validate properly if I copy and paste into the HTML validator straight from my source files.

Usually in order to properly validate these types of files, it's recommended to
[validate by uri](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_uri) from the deployed Heroku pages.

Unfortunately, nearly all of the pages on this site require a user to be logged-in and authenticated,
and will not work using this method, due to the fact that the HTML Validator (W3C) doesn't have
access to login to the pages.

In order to properly validate my HTML pages with Jinja syntax for authenticated pages, I followed these steps:

- Navigate to the deployed pages which require authentication
- Right-click anywhere on the page, and select **View Page Source** (usually `CTRL+U` or `âŒ˜+U` on Mac).
- This will display the entire "compiled" code, without any Jinja syntax.
- Copy everything, and use the [validate by input](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input) method.
- Repeat this process for every page that requires a user to be logged-in/authenticated.

### CSS

I have used the recommended [CSS Jigsaw Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator) to validate my CSS file. On the first test, the validator threw an issue on line 231 of my CSS file saying that 0.3s is not a transform value. This alerted me to a typo in my CSS where I should have put transition instead of transform. I fixed this error and on my second validation test, no errors were thrown.

## Automated Testing

I have conducted a series of automated tests on my application.

I fully acknowledge and understand that, in a real-world scenario, an extensive set of additional tests would be more comprehensive.

### JavaScript (Jest Testing)

I have used the [Jest](https://jestjs.io) JavaScript testing framework to test the application functionality.

In order to work with Jest, I first had to initialize NPM.

- `npm init`
- Hit `enter` for all options, except for **test command:**, just type `jest`.

Add Jest to a list called **Dev Dependencies** in a dev environment:

- `npm install --save-dev jest`

**IMPORTANT**: Initial configurations

When creating test files, the name of the file needs to be `file-name.test.js` in order for Jest to properly work.

Due to a change in Jest's default configuration, you'll need to add the following code to the top of the `.test.js` file:

```js
/**
 * @jest-environment jsdom
 */

const { test, expect } = require("@jest/globals");
const { function1, function2, function3, etc. } = require("../script-name");

beforeAll(() => {
    let fs = require("fs");
    let fileContents = fs.readFileSync("index.html", "utf-8");
    document.open();
    document.write(fileContents);
    document.close();
});
```

Remember to adjust the `fs.readFileSync()` to the specific file you'd like you test.
The example above is testing the `index.html` file.

Finally, at the bottom of the script file where your primary scripts are written, include the following at the bottom of the file.
Make sure to include the name of all of your functions that are being tested in the `.test.js` file.

```js
if (typeof module !== "undefined") module.exports = {
    function1, function2, function3, etc.
};
```

Now that these steps have been undertaken, further tests can be written, and be expected to fail initially.
Write JS code that can get the tests to pass as part of the Red-Green refactor process.

Once ready, to run the tests, use this command:

- `npm test`

**NOTE**: To obtain a coverage report, use the following command:

- `npm test --coverage`

Below are the results from the tests that I've written for this application:

| Test Suites | Tests | Coverage | Screenshot |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 passed | 16 passed | 55% | ![screenshot](documentation/js-test-coverage.png) |
| x | x | x | repeat for all remaining tests |

#### Jest Test Issues

Use this section to list any known issues you ran into while writing your Jest tests.
Remember to include screenshots (where possible), and a solution to the issue (if known).

This can be used for both "fixed" and "unresolved" issues.

### Python (Unit Testing)

I have used Django's built-in unit testing framework to test the application functionality.

In order to run the tests, I ran the following command in the terminal each time:

`python3 manage.py test name-of-app `

To create the coverage report, I would then run the following commands:

`coverage run --source=name-of-app manage.py test`

`coverage report`

To see the HTML version of the reports, and find out whether some pieces of code were missing, I ran the following commands:

`coverage html`

`python3 -m http.server`

Below are the results from the various apps on my application that I've tested:

| App | File | Coverage | Screenshot |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Bag | test_forms.py | 99% | ![screenshot](documentation/py-test-bag-forms.png) |
| Bag | test_models.py | 89% | ![screenshot](documentation/py-test-bag-models.png) |
